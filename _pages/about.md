I am a second year M.S. student at KAIST in [Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) Lab](https://www.mlai-kaist.com/), under [Prof. Sung Ju Hwang](http://www.sungjuhwang.com/). 

My research interest is mainly on developing deep learning models for understanding graph-structured data and generating graph topology and geometry. I have been working on representation learning and generative model for graph with the application in the molecular graph. Here is my [CV](https://DongkiKim95.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

My research interests include:
* Drug discovery
* Molecular biology
* Generative model
* Graph representation learning
